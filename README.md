# Dollop
## What is Dollop?
Dollop is an open source project licenced under LGPL-3.0 that provides handy functions for the website Ebay, including product management, auction sniping and price monitoring. Dollop also provides a gui interface using JavaFX and an automated RESTful API system, which is very beneficial to software developers who are willing to integrate with Dollop or deploy for server usage.

Dollop can run on any desktop platform or IOT devices that supports Java. An Android portable version is also planned right after we release a stable version.

Currently, dollop mainly focuses on buyer tools.

## How's the development process?
The Dollop project has been suspended for a long time due to technical problems. We're planning to use a real browser to login to Ebay, instead of using Jsoup, which is unable to run JavaScript and lacks many important features.

## Can I contribute?
Absolutely! Dollop is still in early stage development, and we need your help.
